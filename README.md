My personal website https://aaronshekey.com/

This site uses grunt tasks to build its pages. In Terminal, within the project’s directory, type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Then, run `npm start` and it’ll build the pages and serve them for you. Merging to `master` deploys the site. ✌️
