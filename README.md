My personal website https://aaronshekey.com/

This site uses grunt tasks to build its pages. In Terminal, within the projectâ€™s directory, type `grunt watch` to observe any changes in the `src` folder. This will assemble the site within the `build` directory each time you change something, CSS for example.

Locally, you should have MAMP serve the `build` directory to view the site in the browser.

At any point, you can run `grunt deploy` to deploy to the production environment.
