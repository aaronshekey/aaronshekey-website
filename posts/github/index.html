			<p>TL;DR - I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to be able to announce I&rsquo;ll be joining Github as a Product Designer.</p>

            <p>When I quit Adobe in the spring of 2013, I was unbelievably excited to work on my own product. I immediately started building an iPhone app for songwriters called Hum. Those early days, I was literally jumping out of bed in the mornings (to my girlfriend&rsquo;s dismay). I taught myself Objective-C (just in time for Swift!) and took an idea from rough sketches to a fully shipped product with nearly 10,000 users. I taught myself how to create a business, to pay business taxes, to hire contractors, to write press releases, to shoot, direct, and score promo videos, to answer support and feature request emails.</p>

            <p>Hum was such an incredible opportunity to build a tiny product and a brand from scratch. When you work for a huge corporation like Adobe, many decisions are made that you simply aren&rsquo;t privy to. This is by design of course, but some of these decisions can have vast implications. Some could easily change the definition of what you&rsquo;re working on. What you&rsquo;re building could easily be canceled. It&rsquo;s easy to get frustrated when a decision you don&rsquo;t understand comes from someone so far removed from process of making something. These decisions weren&rsquo;t often coming from the people you spent those afternoons with at the whiteboard.</p>

            <p>To Adobe&rsquo;s credit, most of Reflow&rsquo;s work was done remotely &mdash;myself in Minneapolis with a mostly distributed engineering team. There were folks in San Diego, Virginia, San Francisco, all over. Going to work meant hopping over to my desk upstairs. My office is perfect. I&rsquo;m surrounded by my guitars, my drum kit, and most importantly, silence. It&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t often get in a shared office environment. It&rsquo;s when I do some of my best thinking. It feels great to fill this silence with my thoughts as I work through a problem. Suffice it to say, remote working suited me. I fell in love.</p>

            <p>When I quit Adobe, I hadn&rsquo;t set out to work two years on my own. I was simply excited for my mistakes to be my own. Building a tiny app for my own songwriting doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pay the bills, but I knew that if I kept my head down and focused on shipping the best thing possible, an incredible opportunity like Github would come along. I just didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d take 2 god damned years! When they put up a job posting for product designers, I replied immediately. I accepted an offer last week. I still feel like I&rsquo;ve conned them into making a huge mistake.</p>

            <h2>So why Github?</h2>

            <p>Reflow was built using Github. It was at the core of our workflow. If ever there was an issue with how one of the features was shaping up, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother real engineers with requests to move something 3 pixels to the right. I could just fix it myself and submit a pull request. This allowed those <em>real</em> engineers to focus on shipping a bug-free, performant experience. I fell in love.</p>

            <p>Hum was also built using Github. I fell in love with filing issues, using wikis to post feature designs, pull requests to introduce new features and UI, and of course, version-controlled code.</p>

            <h2>But seriously, why Github?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Yo dawg, Github uses Github to build Github. This is so important. It ensures you&rsquo;re shipping quality software. When you use something intimately every day, you understand where all the rough spots are. You&rsquo;re more inclined to fix them. If something bothers you, crack open a branch and offer up a pull request.</li>
                <li>Transparency. If you aren&rsquo;t sure why something got shipped or how a decision was made, you can always go back and see some of the discussion on Github. Even better, you could possibly even join the discussion as it&rsquo;s happening. Hell, you could even offer a solution via pull request or filing an issue.</li>
                <li>Remote work! 60% of Github&rsquo;s workforce is remote. Amazing. I&rsquo;ve fallen so deeply in love with working remotely. First at Adobe, and then on Hum. Feeling at home in a quiet space makes me happy. Not having a commute makes me happy. Not being affected by weather, or colleagues being sick or chatty makes me happy. The ability to step back and work asynchronously and uninterrupted makes me happy. Owning my home makes me happy. Playing in my band makes me happy. My best work is done when I&rsquo;m happy.</li>
                <li>Nerds. I&rsquo;ve only ever had a designer title, but I always get close to the metal as possible. When designing websites I made sure to become an expert in HTML and CSS. I also dove as deeply as I could into the backend stack as well. Being able to meet engineers and use their terminology, offer shippable prototypes, or even help out when teams are swamped really helps things get shipped. It helps you avoid impossibilities. With Hum, I learned everything I could about building Objective-C in Xcode. Not a pixel in that app wasn&rsquo;t lovingly crafted by yours truly. Github attracts and empowers these types of designerds.</li>
                <li>The arc. Github made sense to me in regards to the strange unintentional pattern my career has followed. I started at Sevnthsin making websites. I then moved to Adobe to make tools to help make websites. Github allows me to step back further and help make tools for people building tools.</li>
                <li>Growth. Working at Github means working with some of the most talented people whose careers I&rsquo;ve been following for years. They&rsquo;re my colleagues now. Imposter syndrome is real, and I need to step up my shit.</li>
                <li>The future. Github&rsquo;s future is incredibly exciting. They&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to improve every aspect of building software. That&rsquo;s a lofty goal, for sure, but even that perspective is a limited way of looking at it. I&rsquo;m excited where they head next.</li>
                <li>Side projects. I&rsquo;d die if I couldn&rsquo;t continue working on Hum. Github allows for flexible working hours and generous vacation time to follow your passions. This means playing in bands, making records, and shipping software.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>How much better could it get? I&rsquo;m working on a product I use every single day, working from my music studio in the most underrated city on the planet. The wait for the perfect gig was worth it. üòç</p>
