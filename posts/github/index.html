    		<p class="summary">I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to be able to announce I&rsquo;ll be joining <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as a Product Designer.</p>

        <h2>Why GitHub?</h2>

        <h3>Dogfooding.</h3>
        <p>Yo dawg, GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub. This is so important. It ensures you&rsquo;re shipping quality software. When you use something intimately every day, you understand where all the rough spots are. You&rsquo;re more inclined to fix them. If something bothers you, crack open a branch and offer up a pull request.</p>
        <p>My biggest project at Adobe, <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/reflow">Reflow</a>, was built using GitHub. It was at the core of our workflow. If ever there was an issue with how one of the features was shaping up, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother real engineers with requests to move something 3 pixels to the right. I could just fix it myself and submit a pull request. This allowed those <em>real</em> engineers to focus on shipping a bug-free, delightful experience.</p>
        <p><a href="http://justhum.com">Hum</a>, my iPhone app for songwriting, was also built using GitHub. As the product&rsquo;s owner, I&rsquo;d  be filing issues, using wikis to post feature designs, opening pull requests to introduce new features and UI, and of course, committing version-controlled code.</p>
        <p>The best designers should be able to apply design thinking and empathy to just about any problem, but the best solutions come from those who are intimately aware of the problem. It&rsquo;s much more satisfying and motivating to scratch your own itch. I&rsquo;m excited to join the team behind one of the best facilitators of building software.</p>

        <h3>Transparency.</h3>
        <p>At GitHub, if you aren&rsquo;t sure why something got shipped or how a decision was made, you can always go back and view some of the discussion. Even better, you could possibly even join a debate as it&rsquo;s happening. Hell, you could even offer a solution via pull request or filing an issue.</p>

        <p>Before GitHub, my last full time position was with Adobe&mdash;and when you work for a huge corporation like that, many decisions are made that you simply aren&rsquo;t privy to. This is by design of course, but some of these decisions can have vast implications. Some could easily change the definition of what you&rsquo;re working on. Your project could easily be canceled for any number of reasons. It&rsquo;s easy to get frustrated when a decision you don&rsquo;t understand comes from someone so far removed from process of making something. These decisions weren&rsquo;t often coming from the people you spent those afternoons with at the whiteboard. Again, that&rsquo;s by design.</p>
        <p>By moving these decisions to products like GitHub, a lot of these frustrations can be avoided and <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data">a culture of transparency can be fostered</a>.</p>

        <h3>Remote.</h3>
        <p>60% of GitHub&rsquo;s workforce is remote. This makes working at GitHub an absolute no-brainer. I&rsquo;ve fallen so deeply in love with working remotely. First at Adobe, and then on Hum. Feeling at home in a quiet space makes me happy. Not having a commute makes me happy. Not being affected by weather, or colleagues being sick or chatty makes me happy. The ability to step back and work asynchronously and uninterrupted makes me happy. Owning my home makes me happy. Playing in my band makes me happy.</p>

        <blockquote>My best work is done when I&rsquo;m happy.</blockquote>

        <p>Most of Reflow&rsquo;s work was done remotely &mdash;myself in Minneapolis with a mostly distributed engineering team. My managers took a chance on me and allowed me to move home from San Francisco. A majority of the team was remote as well. There were folks in San Diego, Virginia, San Francisco, all over. Going to work meant hopping over to my desk upstairs.</p>
        <p>My office is perfect. I&rsquo;m surrounded by my guitars, my drum kit, and most importantly, silence. It&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t often get in a shared office environment. It&rsquo;s when I do some of my best thinking. It feels great to fill this silence with my thoughts as I work through a problem&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t have to smell someone else&rsquo;s lunch.</p>

        <h3>Nerds.</h3>
        <p>Though I&rsquo;ve only ever had a designer title, I always get as close to the metal as possible. When designing websites I made sure to become an expert in HTML and CSS. I also dove as deeply as I could into the backend stack as well. Being able to meet engineers halfway and use their terminology, offer shippable prototypes, or even help out when teams are swamped really helps things get shipped. It helps you avoid impossibilities. With Hum, I learned everything I could about building Objective-C in Xcode. Not a pixel in that app wasn&rsquo;t lovingly crafted by yours truly (and then ruthlessly refactored by <a href="http://github.com/designatednerd">Ellen</a>). GitHub attracts and empowers these types of designerds. I feel right at home.</p>

        <h3>Growth</h3>
        <p>My career has followed a strange, unintentional arc. I first started at Sevnthsin making websites. I then moved to Adobe to make tools to help make websites. GitHub allows me to step further back and help make tools for people building tools. Working at GitHub means working with some of the most talented people whose careers I&rsquo;ve been following for years. They&rsquo;re my colleagues now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter syndrome</a> is real, and I need to step up my shit.</p>

        <h3>Side projects.</h3>
        <p>I&rsquo;d die if I couldn&rsquo;t continue working on Hum. GitHub offers flexible working hours and generous vacation time to allow you to follow your passions. For me it means being able to play in my bands, make records, and ship updates to Hum.</p>
        <p>When I quit Adobe in the spring of 2013, I was unbelievably excited to work on my own product. I immediately started building Hum. In those early days, I was literally jumping out of bed in the mornings (to my girlfriend&rsquo;s dismay). I taught myself Objective-C (just in time for Swift!) and took an idea from rough sketches to a fully shipped product with nearly 10,000 users. I taught myself how to create a business, pay taxes on that business, hire contractors, write press releases, shoot, direct, and score promo videos, and even answer support and feature request emails.</p>
        <p>Hum was such an incredible opportunity to build a tiny product and a brand from scratch. I plan to continue working on Hum.</p>

        <p>When I quit Adobe, I hadn&rsquo;t quite planned on working for two years on my own. I was just simply excited to learn and grow and for my mistakes to be my own. Building a tiny app for my own songwriting doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pay the bills, but it&rsquo;s made enough money to re-invest in new features. I knew that if I kept my head down and focused on shipping the best thing possible, an incredible opportunity like GitHub would come along. I just didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d take 2 goddamned years! When they put up a job posting for product designers, I replied immediately. I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that I accepted an offer last week&mdash;I still feel like I&rsquo;ve conned them into making a huge mistake.</p>

        <h3>The future.</h3>
        <p>GitHub&rsquo;s future is incredibly exciting. They&rsquo;ve got the opportunity to improve every aspect of building software. Even if that perspective is a limited way of looking at it, it&rsquo;s still a lofty goal. I&rsquo;m excited where they are headed next.</p>


        <h2>So why GitHub?</h2>
        <p>How much better could it get? I&rsquo;m working on a product I use every single day, for a company that fosters and facilitates the creation of some of my favorite software, while working from my music studio in the most underrated city on the planet. Well when you put it that way&hellip;</p>
