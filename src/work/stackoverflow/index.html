    <h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
    <p class="meta">2017—</p>

    <p>I joined Stack Overflow in the spring of 2017 as a product designer on their then in-beta product, Documentation. After that, I worked on various Q&A efforts. Eventually, I'd create and maintain their design system, <a href="https://stackoverflow.design">Stacks</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

    <p>Documentation was Stack Overflow's attempt to improve technical reference materials by focusing on real world examples. Instead of simply documenting an API's methods and parameters, Stack Overflow users could submit real-world examples of those APIs in use, each attempting to create <em>the</em> canonical example and gaining reputation for doing so. Just like answers to questions, examples could be upvoted—the best ones rising to the top.</p>

    <p>At the time, I was coming off having written Hum, an iOS app for songwriting. Apple has amazing APIs in their iOS SDK, but many of their symbols <a href="https://nooverviewavailable.com">lack official documentation</a>. Additionally, this documentation fails to include rich examples, especially community-created examples to show how these methods are <em>actually</em> used. On top of an overall lack of documentation, the APIs often were half-implemented, and required workarounds found deep within Stack Overflow's question base.</p>

    <p>Documentation was an initial success. However, after the gold rush of early adopters adding their own canonical examples, usage began to decline. Myself, product manager Vasudha, and research intern Horyun, were tasked with figuring out how to build the next phase of Documentation.</p>

    <p>This meant doing basic research about what Documentation should be, who it'd be for, and what people expected Stack Overflow's version of Documentation would be. Horyun wrote in depth about her <a href="http://horyun.design/docs">research methodology</a>, and her <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/life-as-a-stack-overflow-user-research-intern-ff9ce133996a">time at Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

    <p>After initial rounds of research, we needed to test actual visuals of what this new version of Documentation might look like.</p>

      We tested basic layouts before diving into full mockups
    </div>

    <p>We then moved on to testing mock layouts using pseudo documentation to gather what users valued from documentation around the web.</p>

      In these mockups, we established the page layout while also exploring individual sections that were editable.

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/documentation02.png" alt="Documentation editing" width="1124">
      Early explorations on editing allowed for WYSIWYG-style editing of sections.

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/documentation04.png" alt="Documentation creation" width="1124">
      Creating new topics would allow for template selection
    </div>

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/documentation05.png" alt="Full documentation" width="1124">
      A full pseudo layout with everything a topic might have.
    </div>

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/documentation03.png" alt="Documentation responsiveness" width="829">
      Documentation would support responsive layouts on day one.
    </div>

    <p>These explorations all tested very well, but ultimately it would have been too much investment to build what Documentation truly required to succeed. The failure of Documentation changed Stack Overflow's approach to product development across the company, moving beyond “let's develop a new product and see how it goes” and into more robust research into product and market fit.</p>
