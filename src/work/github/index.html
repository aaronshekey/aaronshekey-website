      <p>I had the opportunity to work full-time as a remote Product Designer at GitHub from March 2015 to October 2016. This is a collection of the work that I was able to help ship during my time as a Hubber™.</p>

      <h3>Markdown Toolbar</h3>

      <p>In early conversations with GitHub, I'd shared my desire to help simplify some of their core experiences. Increasingly, GitHub is used by non-programmers and programmers alike. Issue triage and project management are often equally as important as the code itself, especially as an organization grows.</p>

      <p>All of the comment fields throughout github.com support GitHub-flavored Markdown. Markdown is a syntax that allows folks to make richer comments—adding things like links, lists, and images. Unfortunately, a great wealth of useful features were hidden behind this syntax. This seemed like a decent opportunity to add a lightweight toolbar to surface some of these. Prior to joining, we only had a link to a help document explaining the syntax.</p>
