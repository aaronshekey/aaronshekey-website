    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p class="meta">March 2015 — October 2016</p>

    <p>I had the opportunity to work full-time as a remote Product Designer at GitHub from March 2015 to October 2016. This is a collection of the work that I was able to help ship during my time as a Hubber™.</p>

    <h3>Markdown Toolbar</h3>

    <p>In early conversations with GitHub, I'd shared my desire to help simplify some of their core experiences. Increasingly, GitHub is used by non-programmers and programmers alike. Issue triage and project management are often equally as important as the code itself, especially as an organization grows.</p>

    <p>All of the comment fields throughout github.com support GitHub-flavored Markdown. Markdown is a syntax that allows folks to make richer comments—adding things like links, lists, and images. Unfortunately, a great wealth of useful features were hidden behind this syntax. This seemed like a decent opportunity to add a lightweight toolbar to surface some of these. Prior to joining, we only had a link to a help document explaining the syntax.</p>

    <h4>Exploration</h4>

    <p>My first exploration into the feature was considering revamping the "Write" and "Preview" pane. I wanted to swap them for "Visual" and "Markdown". Our visual editor would render Markdown on the fly, allowing full use of the toolbar for formatting text. If this wasn't desired, users could always flip tabs to see their raw Markdown. We'd remember that preference and allow for folks to ignore the Visual editor entirely. This style of editing was popularized by Wordpress.</p>

    <img src="media/markdown-wysiwyg-visual.png" title="Visual" width="760">
    <img src="media/markdown-wysiwyg-markdown.png" title="Markdown" width="760">

    <p>This being the very first issue I'd posted to <span class="highlight">github/github</span>, it was wisely suggested that I scale back the scope of modifying our site-wide comment box. Fair enough!</p>

    <img src="media/markdown-inline.png" title="Half" width="760">

    <p>I then wanted to try to add light styling to the Write tab. This could allow for less toggling between the Write and Preview tab. Italics, for example, could be rendered inline. This is a popular pattern and turns up in lots of Markdown-based apps like iA Writer.</p>

    <h4>Final approach</h4>

    <p>Ultimately, we ended up building a single toolbar for our GitHub Flavored Markdown without modifying either of the tabs. Instead of hiding functionality behind a help link, we put our powerful, but less-used features up front. Task lists, for example, are a really powerful project management tool that very few users knew about. The toolbar shows powerful features while making it easier for beginners to use GitHub. Rad!</p>

    <img src="media/markdown-final.png" title="Toolbar" width="626">

    <p>In our iterations, we stripped the button treatment on the toolbar. Since we didn't want this feature to feel intrusive, this made things a lot lighter. We also ended up grouping things by similar task. Text manipulations, links and media, lists, and less-used GitHub-flavored Markdown features are all properly grouped.</p>

    <img src="media/markdown-toolbar.png" title="Toolbar" width="626">

    <p>The heavy lifting on this feature was done by <a href="http://github.com/skalnik">@skalnik</a> and <a href="http://github.com/probablycorey">@probablycorey</a>. I drew pretty pictures and provided the UI work. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2097-improved-commenting-with-markdown">product release blog post</a>.</p>

    <h3>Re-orderable Task Lists</h3>

    <p>After our markdown toolbar shipped, many users would soon discover our task list feature.</p>

    <img src="media/tasklist.png" title="Tasklist" width="660">

    <p>These are interactive lists that allow users to add tasks that can be checked off as they're completed. They're often used to describe the scope of the work left in a particular issue or pull request. They're also used in meta issues, that act as a way to track the status of other issues or pull requests. Whenever issues or pull requests are displayed in a list, we expose the number of completed tasks in the issue body as a progress bar.</p>

    <img src="media/tasklist-progress.png" title="Tasklist progress" width="596">

    <p>Since users were now using task lists more frequently, we received lots of feedback asking for the ability to re-arrange these items without having to edit the underlying Markdown content.</p>

    <h4>Exploration</h4>

    <p>Early in the exploration of this feature, we discovered that since the task lists were already indented, we could use this empty space to show a drag affordance on hover. After a quick number of iterations, we landed on a simple three-bar metaphor.</p>

    <img src="media/tasklist-bugs.png" title="Tasklist grabbers" width="596">

    <h4>Final approach</h4>
    <p>On highlight, we'll show the grabber, but we'll only change the cursor when the mouse is to the left of the checkbox so as not to interfere with text selection and checking the box.</p>

    <h3>File Uploads</h3>
    <p>Adding files to a repository on GitHub can be difficult. GitHub has great workflows for adding and editing single documents, even allowing users to create Pull Requests from these edits. Oddly, there was no simply way of dragging and dropping files into a repository.</p>

    <img src="media/upload-blank-slate.png" title="Repo blank slate" width="980">

    <p>For many users, a user interface will always be more accessible than a command line. Perhaps we could cater to those users.</p>
    <h4>Exploration</h4>


    <p>My first explorations started with dragging and dropping files onto the file tree. I thought we could be clever and use the file tree's background as both the drop target and the progress bar. In practice, it was a bit frustrating that the file tree didn't have a fixed size. If a repository only had a single file in it, we would only have about a 20px drop target. Easy to miss, and hard to discover, especially for a feature that should be optimized for empty or nearly-empty repositories.</p>

    <img src="media/upload-file-drop.png" title="Upload file drop" width="790">
    <img src="media/upload-file-progress.png" title="Upload file progress" width="790">
    <img src="media/upload-file-drop-bad.png" title="Upload file drop" width="790">

    <h4>Final approach</h4>
    <p>The next exploration moved to a full-window'd drop target. This allowed users to more easily drop their files anywhere in the code view regardless of the number of files their repository has.</p>

    <img class="rounded" src="media/upload.gif" title="Upload file" width="1320">

    <p>While this was certainly better for users familiar with dragging and dropping, it wasn't very discoverable or accessible.</p>
    <p>This led the team to add an explicit <span class="highlight">upload</span> button that would present an entirely new view with both a drop target and file chooser.</p>

    <img src="media/upload-page-empty.png" title="Empty file upload page" width="790">
    <img src="media/upload-page-full.png" title="Uploading file upload page" width="790">


    <p>In addition to a progress bar, we now had a consistent place for error messages and other edge cases. We could also allow users to stage their files and delete any errant uploads before opening a Pull Request.</p>

    <p>Simply adding an upload button to our code view revealed a bit of design debt. We were quickly running out of space to add these buttons, and our design was suffering as a result. A small side-project revealed a couple optimizations.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>We could group all of the file-related actions and be more explicit with button copy.</li>
      <li>We could hide some of the unnecessary cloning options within a dropdown.</li>
      <li>We could actually say "clone" within the interface. We hadn't done that for a couple iterations and users found it confusing.</li>
      <li>We could free up some space in the interface for additional future features.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories">This feature</a> was written about on GitHub's blog. Early explorations were with the help of <a href="https://github.com/mdo">@mdo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jasonlong">@jasonlong</a>. The feature was built by <a href="https://github.com/skalnik">@skalnik</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dgraham">@dgraham</a>.

    <h3>Protected branches</h3>

    <p>Since a lot of GitHub's userbase was becoming part of a larger team, we started building features that allowed for more granular permissions where possible. Too often in organizations large and small, someone might accidentally push directly to the wrong branch, <span class="highlight">master</span>, for example. In worst-case scenarios, this could result in lost work via force push.</p>

    <p>Protected Branches allow for repository administrators to block pushing to certain branches. This required adding a setting page that allowed for protected branch management.</p>

    <img class="rounded" src="media/protected-branches.png" title="Branch selection" width="935">

    <p>In addition to blocking pushing directly to the protected branch, administrators can require status checks. These statuses are bots that can check for all sorts of things—code quality and linting, integration tests, regressions, etc.</p>

    <p>When these status checks fail, you can disable merging to the protected branch.</p>

    <img class="rounded" src="media/protected-branches-status.png" title="Status" width="775">

    <p>Since both our settings page user interface language and our merge area were well established, most of the design work for protected branches was focused on writing clear, balanced copy that was balanced, discoverable, marketing, and each edge case for when something didn't behave normally—a rogue status test, for example.</p>

    <p>Protected branches was one of the first features I worked on at GitHub. The details are fuzzy, but it was mostly built by <a href="https://github.com/aroben">@aroben</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rsanheim">@rsanheim</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nakajima">@nakajima</a> with product direction being provided by <a href="https://github.com/bleikamp">@bleikamp</a>. I think ✌️. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2051-protected-branches-and-required-status-checks">blog post announcing the feature</a>.</p>

    <h3>Saved Replies</h3>

    <p>When a large number of GitHub power users started to talk about their desire for re-usable snippets of text throughout <span class="highlight">dotcom</span>, we thought this might be an opportunity a new feature. Saved replies allow you to create any number of canned responses. These could aid in better bug filing or issue triage, for example. Or perhaps you're just sick of responding to that <em>same</em> feature request or bug.</p>

    <p>With any sufficiently complex product, there are a lot of questions that need to be answered, even for what seems to be a simple feature. Who owns saved replies? Do they belong to the repo? Do they belong to the user? Maybe they should be organization-wide. How will they get saved? Should we just put a Markdown file in the repo directory like we did with Issue and Pull Request templates? Maybe these should be saved to the database.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, I argued users would get the most utility out of their saved replies being stored in the database at the user level. This way, we could easily test their usage and they'd follow users around to any repo, regardless of organizational ownership. Managing your saved replies would show up in your user settings.</p>

    <p>Like Protected Branches, much of this design system already existed, making for short work of adding the settings page.</p>

    <img src="media/saved-reply-settings.png" width="980">

    <p>Since we'd added the Markdown toolbar to all our comment areas, it made sense to add saved replies as another GitHub-specific button.</p>

    <img src="media/saved-reply-toolbar.png" width="731">

    <p>I worked hard to introduce the feature with its blank slate. When folks started to add their saved replies, I wanted to make sure they were able to easily add saved replies from the toolbar, providing a shortcut to the settings page.

    <h3>Octicons</h3>
    <p>GitHub.com and every other GitHub property (Atom, GitHub Desktop, GitHub Universe, etc.) uses an icon library called <a href="http://octicons.github.com/">Octicons</a>. These are little 16x16px vectors that are <a href="https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg">delivered via SVG</a>. This allows for resolution-independence as well as coloring on the fly via CSS. We’ve open sourced the set if you want to poke around.</p>

    <h4>Why redesign Octicons?</h4>
    <p>This set of icons includes all the metaphors familiar to you as a user of GitHub—things like forking, branching, pull requests. Perhaps some are less familiar to you. We sought to kill all the icons that were rarely used and to repurpose others.</p>
    <p>This was an opportunity to pare down the icon set. We could also explore making some of their visuals a bit more harmonious. We lost a bit of consistency over the years. Perhaps it was time to try to get some back.</p>
    <p>Prior to 3.0, Octicons were pretty chunky, especially when paired with system fonts, with different stroke weights appearing throughout the set. Corner radii were inconsistent. Nested corners were the same radius as their parents, leaving things feeling unnatural. Some icons suffered from legibility issues.</p>

    </div>

    <h4>Exploration</h4>
    <p>In early style explorations, it became obvious that there wasn’t a ton we were going to be able to change within the core Git icons. Thinning them to 1px left them fragile, unreadable. Since we’ve built a brand around these metaphors, changing them wildly was out of the question. These icons would have to stay put.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/octicons-thin-git.png" width="152">

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/octicons-square-git.png" width="162">
      Square git icons
    </div>

    <p>Previous efforts had normalized all strokes to 2px based on these icons. This made all the icons really thick, leaving little room for detail on inner shapes.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/octicons-chunky-issues.png" width="56">
      Chunky issues
    </div>

    <p>And since we’re on a grid of 16, single pixel shapes are impossible to center-align without them favoring the right or left side.</p>

    <h4>Final stylings</h4>
    <p>These explorations led to a loose rule of 1px outer strokes, supported by a 2px inner stroke. Some of these strokes would have to be fussed over, optically, to keep things from appearing too razor-thin.</p>
    <p>There were some exceptions to this rule. File-types, for example, were really muddied by 2px inner strokes.</p>

    <div class="caption">
      <img src="media/octicons-file-icons.png" width="78">

    </div>

    <p>We also standardized on 1px corner radii to soften the overall appearance of the iconset. We were careful to never double those corners on the inside, leaving the edges hard. The calendar icon shows these rules well.</p>

      <img src="media/octicons-corner-radius-detail.png" width="208">

    </div>

    <h4>Context vs. Consistency</h4>
    <p>When building icon sets, it’s easy to fall into the trap of working on them all within a single canvas. This can be a form of tunnel vision. It certainly means a more harmonious set, but it can easily create a worse experience when they’re viewed in context of a large app like GitHub. Our folder icons, for example, needed to be filled so users could more easily discern between files and folders.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the sizing of certain icons needed to be revisited once they were shown in context. Strokes, baselines, and overall metaphors needed to be changed as well.</p>

    <h4>Practical Changes</h4>
    <p>Taking a fresh look at our icon set allowed us the opportunity to revisit a couple metaphors used throughout GitHub.com. We were able to swap our global notifications icon from an inbox icon (aka "Robot Bikini Top") to a more common bell shape.</p>
    <p>We also embraced a redrawn gear, shying away from our ‘tools’ icon for settings and the like.</p>
    <p>These aren’t earth-shattering revelations. They’re just icons, after all.</p>
    <p>This new aesthetic should offer a strong rationale for future and current icons. We iterate on these often. As new features drop, we’ll consider new metaphors to support them.</p>
    <p>This was but one step toward a more cohesive, harmonious GitHub experience.</p>
