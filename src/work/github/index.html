      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p class="meta">March 2015 — October 2016</p>

      <p>I had the opportunity to work full-time as a remote Product Designer at GitHub from March 2015 to October 2016. This is a collection of the work that I was able to help ship during my time as a Hubber™.</p>

      <h3>Markdown Toolbar</h3>

      <p>In early conversations with GitHub, I'd shared my desire to help simplify some of their core experiences. Increasingly, GitHub is used by non-programmers and programmers alike. Issue triage and project management are often equally as important as the code itself, especially as an organization grows.</p>

      <p>All of the comment fields throughout github.com support GitHub-flavored Markdown. Markdown is a syntax that allows folks to make richer comments—adding things like links, lists, and images. Unfortunately, a great wealth of useful features were hidden behind this syntax. This seemed like a decent opportunity to add a lightweight toolbar to surface some of these. Prior to joining, we only had a link to a help document explaining the syntax.</p>

      <h4>Exploration</h4>

      <p>My first exploration into the feature was considering revamping the "Write" and "Preview" pane. I wanted to swap them for "Visual" and "Markdown". Our visual editor would render Markdown on the fly, allowing full use of the toolbar for formatting text. If this wasn't desired, users could always flip tabs to see their raw Markdown. We'd remember that preference and allow for folks to ignore the Visual editor entirely. This style of editing was popularized by Wordpress.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>This being the very first issue I'd posted to <span class="highlight">github/github</span>, it was wisely suggested that I scale back the scope of modifying our site-wide comment box. Fair enough!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/markdown-inline.png" title="Half" width="760">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>I then wanted to try to add light styling to the Write tab. This could allow for less toggling between the Write and Preview tab. Italics, for example, could be rendered inline. This is a popular pattern and turns up in lots of Markdown-based apps like iA Writer.</p>

      <h4>Final approach</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Ultimately, we ended up building a single toolbar for our GitHub Flavored Markdown without modifying either of the tabs. Instead of hiding functionality behind a help link, we put our powerful, but less-used features up front. Task lists, for example, are a really powerful project management tool that very few users knew about. The toolbar shows powerful features while making it easier for beginners to use GitHub. Rad!</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>In our iterations, we stripped the button treatment on the toolbar. Since we didn't want this feature to feel intrusive, this made things a lot lighter. We also ended up grouping things by similar task. Text manipulations, links and media, lists, and less-used GitHub-flavored Markdown features are all properly grouped.</p>

      <p>The heavy lifting on this feature was done by <a href="http://github.com/skalnik">@skalnik</a> and <a href="http://github.com/probablycorey">@probablycorey</a>. I drew pretty pictures and provided the UI work. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/blog/2097-improved-commenting-with-markdown">product release blog post</a>.</p>

      <h3>Re-orderable Task Lists</h3>

      <p>After our markdown toolbar shipped, many users would soon discover our task list feature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/tasklist.png" title="Tasklist" width="660">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>These are interactive lists that allow users to add tasks that can be checked off as they're completed. They're often used to describe the scope of the work left in a particular issue or pull request. They're also used in meta issues, that act as a way to track the status of other issues or pull requests. Whenever issues or pull requests are displayed in a list, we expose the number of completed tasks in the issue body as a progress bar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/tasklist-progress.png" title="Tasklist progress" width="596">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Since users were now using task lists more frequently, we received lots of feedback asking for the ability to re-arrange these items without having to edit the underlying Markdown content.</p>
      <h4>Exploration</h4>
      <p>Early in the exploration of this feature, we discovered that since the task lists were already indented, we could use this empty space to show a drag affordance on hover. After a quick number of iterations, we landed on a simple three-bar metaphor.</p>
    </div>

      <img src="media/tasklist-bugs.png" title="Tasklist grabbers" width="596">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h4>Final approach</h4>
      <p>On highlight, we'll show the grabber, but we'll only change the cursor when the mouse is to the left of the checkbox so as not to interfere with text selection and checking the box.</p>

      <h3>File Uploads</h3>
      <p>Adding files to a repository on GitHub can be difficult. GitHub has great workflows for adding and editing single documents, even allowing users to create Pull Requests from these edits. Oddly, there was no simply way of dragging and dropping files into a repository.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/upload-blank-slate.png" title="Repo blank slate" width="980">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>For many users, a user interface will always be more accessible than a command line. Perhaps we could cater to those users.</p>
      <h4>Exploration</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>My first explorations started with dragging and dropping files onto the file tree. I thought we could be clever and use the file tree's background as both the drop target and the progress bar. In practice, it was a bit frustrating that the file tree didn't have a fixed size. If a repository only had a single file in it, we would only have about a 20px drop target. Easy to miss, and hard to discover, especially for a feature that should be optimized for empty or nearly-empty repositories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/upload-file-drop.png" title="Upload file drop" width="790"><br>
      <img src="media/upload-file-progress.png" title="Upload file progress" width="790"><br>
      <img src="media/upload-file-drop-bad.png" title="Upload file drop" width="790">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h4>Final approach</h4>
      <p>The next exploration moved to a full-window'd drop target. This allowed users to more easily drop their files anywhere in the code view regardless of the number of files their repository has.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image rounded">
      <img src="media/upload.gif" title="Upload file" width="1320">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>While this was certainly better for users familiar with dragging and dropping, it wasn't very discoverable or accessible.</p>
      <p>This led the team to add an explicit <span class="highlight">upload</span> button that would present an entirely new view with both a drop target and file chooser.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="media/upload-page-empty.png" title="Empty file upload page" width="790"><br>
      <img src="media/upload-page-full.png" title="Uploading file upload page" width="790">
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>In addition to a progress bar, we now had a consistent place for error messages and other edge cases. We could also allow users to stage their files and delete any errant uploads before opening a Pull Request.</p>

      <p>Simply adding an upload button to our code view revealed a bit of design debt. We were quickly running out of space to add these buttons, and our design was suffering as a result. A small side-project revealed a couple optimizations.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <ol>
        <li>Group all of the file-related actions and be more explicit with button copy.</li>
        <li>Hide some of the unnecessary cloning options within a single group.</li>
        <li>Actually say clone within the interface. We hadn't done that for a couple iterations and I found it confusing.</li>
        <li>Create some space in the interface for additional future features.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories">This feature</a> was written about on GitHub's blog. Early explorations were with the help of <a href="https://github.com/mdo">@mdo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jasonlong">@jasonlong</a>. The feature was built by <a href="https://github.com/skalnik">@skalnik</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dgraham">@dgraham</a>.

      <h3>Protected branches</h3>

      <p>Since a lot of GitHub's userbase was becoming part of a larger team, we started building features that allowed for more granular permissions where possible. Too often in organizations large and small, someone might accidentally push directly to the wrong branch, <span class="highlight">master</span>, for example. In worst-case scenarios, this could result in lost work via force push.</p>

      <p>Protected Branches allow for repository administrators to block pushing to certain branches. This required adding a setting page that allowed for protected branch management.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <p>[branch selection]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>In addition to blocking pushing directly to the protected branch, administrators can require status checks. These statuses are bots that can check for all sorts of things—code quality and linting, integration tests, regressions, etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <p>[add status checks]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>When these status checks fail, you can disable merging to the protected branch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image">
      <p>[disabled merge button]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Since both our settings page user interface language and our merge area were well established, most of the design work for protected branches was focused on writing clear, balanced copy that was balanced, discoverable, marketing, and each edge case for when something didn't behave normally—a rogue status test, for example.</p>

      <h3>Saved Replies</h3>

      <p>When a large number of GitHub power users started to talk about their desire for re-usable snippets of text throughout <span class="highlight">dotcom</span>, we thought this might be an opportunity a new feature. Saved replies allow you to create any number of canned responses. These could aid in better bug filing or issue triage, for example. Or perhaps you're just sick of responding to that <em>same</em> feature request or bug.</p>

      <p>With any sufficiently complex product, there are a lot of questions that need to be answered, even for what seems to be a simple feature. Who owns saved replies? Do they belong to the repo? Do they belong to the user? Maybe they should be organization-wide. How will they get saved? Should we do a Markdown file in the repo directory like we did with Issue and Pull Request templates? Maybe these should be saved to the database.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, I argued users would get the most utility out of their saved replies being stored in the database at the user level. This way, we could easily test their usage and they'd follow users around to any repo, regardless of organizational ownership.</p>
