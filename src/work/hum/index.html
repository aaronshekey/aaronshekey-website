	  <p>Hum is an iPhone app for songwriters. It collects all your lyrics, melodies, ideas, or riffs into one single, sortable place. It keeps all your ideas organized by key, tuning, and mood.</p>
    <p>Hum began as a shared problem between myself and Joseph Kuefler. We were tired of losing song ideas to voice memos and voicemails.</p>

    <p>Keith Richards tells the tale of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” in <a href="http://performingsongwriter.com/rolling-stones-satisfaction/" target="_blank">Performing Songwriter</a>:</p>

		<blockquote class="long">
			<p>On May 7, 1965, Keith Richards woke up in the middle of the night with a melody in his head. He was in a room at the Gulf Motel in Clearwater, Florida. His guitar was on the bed beside him. Fumbling around in the dark, he found his portable cassette recorder on the nightstand. He pushed the record button and played an eight-note riff. It was accompanied by the mumbled vocal line, “I can’t get no satisfaction.” Then he fell back asleep.</p>

			<p>“On the tape you can hear me drop the pick,” Richards recalled. “The rest is me snoring.”</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Modern musicians have an amazing tape recorder with them at all times—their phones.</p>
		<p>In fact, rather literally, the very first idea for my band The Usual Things’ song <a href="http://music.theusualthings.com/track/the-radio-2" target="_blank">“The Radio”</a> was recorded by phone as a voicemail. I’d excused myself from the meal I was at, borrowed a phone, exited the restaurant, and sang to myself in the parking lot.</p>

    <p>Since the iPhone, our tools have evolved only slightly. Most musicians I’ve interviewed have a similar songwriting process. We play a bit on the guitar or piano, whatever our instrument of choice is. We stumble across a riff or progression that we want to remember or build on. We open our iPhone to Voice Memos and record about a minute or two. If it’s really solid we’ll email it to ourselves or text to bandmates.</p>

      A suite of apps to solve a single problem isn’t ideal.
    </div>

	  <p>The problem is once ideas are in a voice memo, they’re often lost. You can’t sort them. They’re hard to revisit. Names are based on the date they were recorded. You have no idea what key they’re in or how your guitar was tuned.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, lyrics are written at the time of inspiration&mdash;sitting on a bus, waiting in the airport, watching a show. They’re collected as Notes. They exist between shopping lists and todos. The context for these works are lost. You can’t assign audio memos to the lyrics.</p>

    <p>So you press record in Voice Memos, switch over to Notes, sing the lyrics while strumming the guitar. Trim and share. This could be simplified. I got to sketching.</p>

      Like the name, the sketches seemed obvious, and simple.

		<p>I moved quickly to Photoshop. Originally, Hum was designed to be built for iOS6. It featured an “almost flat” look featuring buttons with very obvious shadows and structure, almost as if it was a physical device.</p>

		  You’ll also notice the main color was red. We thought it went well with the notion of recording.
    </div>

	  <p>Shortly after our designs, iOS7 was announced. <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronshekey/statuses/384408590691225600" target="_blank">I</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronshekey/statuses/380706534746898434" target="_blank">wasn’t</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronshekey/statuses/366972119357210625" target="_blank">thrilled</a>. On top of a jarring, new aesthetic, the iOS7 music app looked pretty similar to our red, early versions of Hum.</p>

    <p>The teal was originally meant to be a secondary color we could use for branding and illustration purposes. With the switch to iOS7, we rolled with it as our primary color. We flattened some things out, taking cues from the only control in iOS with any shadow whatsoever—UISlider.</p>

    <h3>The App</h3>

	  <p>Hum is an audio recorder meets lyric-writing app. You can start with either an audio recording or lyrics.</p>

    <p>All your Hums are sortable by some meta data that you can apply after recording a song. We’ve shied away from major / minor tonality, and instead rely on a single root note. By only sorting by a single note you’ll get some interesting combinations you wouldn’t otherwise get when mixing potential verses and choruses. It also makes for a simpler implementation.</p>

    <p>Users can also apply tuning and mood-based meta data and filters.</p>

	  <p>Each Hum has a page of lyrics, meta data, and notes. Hums can be shared via email or iMessage.</p>

    <p>After solidifying the design of the product, I shifted my attention to Hum’s website. It’s fully responsive and explains Hum clearly and concisely. In fact, if you view our site on the phone its screenshots are actually live demos of Hum’s functionality. You can actually edit the lyrics.</p>

	  <p>After a lengthy beta process, Hum was released on January 27th, 2014. It’s been downloaded thousands of times, was featured by Apple as a Best New App, and also carries a 4.5 star rating.</p>
