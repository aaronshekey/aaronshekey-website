    <h2>Write What You Want</h2>
    <p class="meta">February 2018</p>
    <p>One of my favorite moments in Almost Famous is when all our characters have survived what was thought to be a plane crash. The crew deplanes after landing safely and walks down a corridor at a small airport collecting themselves. William vomits in a trash can. After this, Russell tells William, “Write what you want.”</p>
    <p>Beneath this scene is an amazing bit of score assembled from a live version of Neil Young’s Cortez the Killer from his Bridge School Benefit XIII. After many years of listening to audio I ripped directly from the film, I’ve gone to the source and re-edited it to line up with how it was presented in the film. Enjoy this high quality copy. 😎</p>
